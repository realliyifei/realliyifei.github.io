## Dev

Type `gulp` to preview and after development, run `sh deploy.sh` and git push to deploy.

1.	During development, the index.html file should be created in the src folder. According to the [original readme](https://github.com/themesberg/neumorphism-ui-bootstrap/tree/master), you can type `gulp` in the terminal to preview the HTML in the browser.
2.	After completing development, run `sh deploy.sh` to minify the webpage and deploy the index.html file to the root directory. To verify successful minification, check if the file can be previewed on the side panel of VS Code. However, keep in mind that some components may not display perfectly, as the browser provides the most accurate rendering.
